			I am a versatile software engineer with proficient
			frontend expierence. I have worked with a wide range
			of technologies which includes the MERN, LAMP, and FREMP
			stacks. I have also worked with just about every mainstream
			programming language such as python, java, javascript, C,
			and more. Ever since I was young I have always
			had a curiosity for technology. I always wanted to
			know what was going on behind the scenes. What made
			computers tick? How was I able to play incredible
			video games? How can these computers display graphics
			on the screen? These are the questions I asked myself
			and was determined to find the answer to. This is
			what lead me to my pursuit of a degree in computer
			science. I also took personal endevours to discover
			topics I wanted to find answers to. I learn something
			new everyday and the journey will never stop in this
			ever-changing field.

				<p3 class='desc'>As I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in computer science from the University of Tampa, I was very fortunate to have been offered an internship as a Quality Assurance Engineer with BST Global, an ERP solutions company. This internship not only helped provide me with an in depth introduction to quality assurance practices, but also gave me knowledge relating to workflow at an enterprise level along with CI/CD practices with Azure pipelines. During the conclusion of this internship, I was offered an extension, in which I happily accepted and is my current position.</div>

		<p3 class='desc'>This was a final project for my data structures and algorithm course. It works by generating a randomized Rubik's Cube and initalizing a solved one as well. Then, these two objects are set as the root of two individual binary trees referenced as a front and back tree. A series of expansions are performed on each of these trees and a BFS and DFS is performed. Each trees have a set of moves associated with each node referring how to get there from the root. As the searchs are performed, These steps are combined until the orientation of the cube matches a node in both the front and back tree. This gives a combined set of moves to perform on the cube to solve it.</p3>
