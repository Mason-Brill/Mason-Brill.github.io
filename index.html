		<p class="text-left">
			I am a versatile software engineer with proficient
			frontend expierence. I have worked with a wide range
			of technologies which includes the MERN, LAMP, and FREMP
			stacks. I have also worked with just about every mainstream
			programming language such as python, java, javascript, C,
			and more. Ever since I was young I have always
			had a curiosity for technology. I always wanted to
			know what was going on behind the scenes. What made
			computers tick? How was I able to play incredible
			video games? How can these computers display graphics
			on the screen? These are the questions I asked myself
			and was determined to find the answer to. This is
			what lead me to my pursuit of a degree in computer
			science. I also took personal endevours to discover
			topics I wanted to find answers to. I learn something
			new everyday and the journey will never stop in this
			ever-changing field.

				<p3 class='desc'>During the winter/spring of 2024, I took on an internship as a software engineer at the startup Colorantí. This company had a new encryption algorithm they needed to showcase to investors and customers. I was tasked with developing a web application that would serve as demo for users to interact with to showcase how it works. This internship provided me with great hands on, professional software development.</p3>
